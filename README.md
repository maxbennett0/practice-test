# Technical Practice Test

This practice test has been designed to help prospective students prepare for and pass the Technical Exam required for acceptance into the CodeWorks® Immersive Fullstack Course. 

Students will need to demonstrate proficiencies in each of the 5 sections below. 

Successful completion of the exam follows a three strike system. Students must complete the tasks associated with each section missing no more than 2 tasks overall.

In this repository you are provided with three starting files to demonstrate your skill. 

While the sections will not change when taking the actual exam the sub-tasks will vary so be sure to study and understand how to accomplish each of these tasks without references for the actual exam. 

1. **Writing and styling html**
    <!-- - Use the largest heading element to render the message `Hello CodeWorks` to the page -->
    <!-- - Use the smallest heading element to render your name to the page -->
    <!-- - Use a paragraph element to render the short sentence `Coding is Fun!` to the page -->
    <!-- - Use an element to bold only the word `Fun!` in the paragraph above -->
    <!-- - Use an img element to render the following logo to the page `https://bcw.blob.core.windows.net/public/img/8600856373152463` -->
    <!-- - Adjust the height of the logo to be `250px` -->
    <!-- - Apply an inline-style to the largest heading to change the following -->
      <!-- - change the font color to `#ffffff` -->
      <!-- - change the background color to `#111927` -->

2. **Creating and using variables in JavaScript**
    <!-- - Create a variable called `currentYear` and set its value to the current year -->
    <!-- - Create another variable called `jsReleaseYear` and set its value to `1995` -->
    <!-- - Calculate and log the `current age of JavaScript is __` using the two variables above -->
    <!-- - Write a conditional using the variable `ageToVote` to log -->
      <!-- - When true = `JavaScript is old enough to vote` -->
      <!-- - When false = `JavaScript is not old enough to vote` -->
      <!-- - *change the value of `ageToVote` to 100 to ensure both messages will log* -->
3. **Creating and using Loops in JavaScript**
    <!-- - Write a for i loop that will log the numbers 0-100 (*include 0 and 100*) -->
    <!-- - Modify the loop to log only multiples of 10 -->
    <!-- - Log the word `Starting` before the loop runs -->
    <!-- - Use a conditional to log the message `Halfway` when the loop hits the number `50` -->
    <!-- - Log the word `Finished` when the loop concludes -->
4. **Accessing properties on an object in JavaScript**
    <!-- - Use the provided `user` object and dot notation -->
